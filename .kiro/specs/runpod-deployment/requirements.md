# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for deploying the FireRedTTS2 (Voxtral TTS) system on the RunPod cloud platform. FireRedTTS2 is a sophisticated text-to-speech system that supports multi-speaker dialogue generation, voice cloning, multilingual support, and ultra-low latency streaming. The deployment must provide a complete web-based interface for users to interact with the system through their browsers, including real-time audio input/output capabilities for speech-to-speech conversations.

6. WHEN generating dialogue THEN the system SHALL support multi-speaker conversations with speaker switching
7. WHEN accessing through RunPod THEN the system SHALL work correctly through RunPod's HTTP proxy system

### Requirement 4: Audio Processing Pipeline Validation

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to ensure the complete audio processing chain works correctly in the RunPod environment, so that users experience high-quality, low-latency audio processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing audio input THEN the system SHALL handle microphone input with proper sample rate conversion
2. WHEN performing speech recognition THEN the system SHALL maintain accuracy and speed comparable to local deployment
3. WHEN generating TTS output THEN the system SHALL maintain the optimized VAD and Voxtral performance improvements
4. WHEN streaming audio THEN the system SHALL ensure browser compatibility with audio formats and streaming protocols
5. WHEN handling WebSocket connections THEN the system SHALL work correctly through RunPod's proxy system
6. WHEN processing real-time audio THEN the system SHALL maintain first-packet latency under 200ms on appropriate GPU hardware

### Requirement 5: Deployment Automation and Configuration

**User Story:** As a deployment engineer, I want complete, sequential deployment commands and configuration modifications, so that I can deploy the system reliably and repeatedly on RunPod.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing deployment THEN the system SHALL provide step-by-step terminal commands for RunPod's web terminal
2. WHEN installing dependencies THEN the system SHALL handle package installations optimized for RunPod environment
3. WHEN downloading models THEN the system SHALL manage large model downloads with network/storage constraints
4. WHEN configuring the application THEN the system SHALL modify configuration files for RunPod's networking and storage structure
5. WHEN starting services THEN the system SHALL provide commands for application startup with proper port binding
6. WHEN handling failures THEN the system SHALL include error recovery and troubleshooting steps

### Requirement 6: System Testing and Validation

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive testing procedures, so that I can validate the complete system functionality after deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing audio quality THEN the system SHALL validate output matches expected quality standards
2. WHEN measuring latency THEN the system SHALL confirm performance meets the sub-200ms first-packet requirement
3. WHEN testing user experience THEN the system SHALL validate all web interface components function correctly
4. WHEN validating optimizations THEN the system SHALL confirm VAD improvements and Voxtral latency fixes are working
5. WHEN testing through browser THEN the system SHALL validate end-to-end functionality from web interface to audio output
6. WHEN load testing THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent users appropriately for the selected GPU configuration
